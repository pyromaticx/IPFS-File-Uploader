# IPFS File Uploader / FileCannon
A simple Electron / React app that interfaces with an IPFS node to add files to the network. The app will also save any links generated to an internal NoSQL like database - NEDB.

Currently you will need to be running an IPFS daemon for the app to work. In future updates the app will start the daemon automatically.

Requires Node 6 and npm 3
